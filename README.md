## Using this application| Page Layout

On the top of every page, there will be three links to choose from. These links give you the option to:

- view tasks
- view projects (home page)
- logout


The first page after logging in is the "My Projects" page, which also is the home page. Here users can:

- create a new project
- view projects they are involved in


When navigating to the "Create a new project" link, the user will be brought to the "Create a new project" page. The user can then create a new project by entering the following information:

- project name
- project description
- user delegation (Who the project will be assigned to. A list of active users will be displayed where they can be chosen.)


When navigating to current projects on the home page, the user will be brought to a page that is specific to the project chosen. on this page they will see:

- description for the project
- the option to create a new task
- a list of tasks for the project
- each entry in the list will have the name of the project, whom it was assigned to, the start date, due date, and a status that indicates whether the task has been completed or not.


when navigating to "My tasks", the user will be brought to a page that lists out their tasks. The user will see:

- name of task
- start date of task
- end date of task
- is completed status (toggling the "complete" button will change the status to "true"). Toggling this will change the status on other applicable pages.
